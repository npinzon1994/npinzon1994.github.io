This is a professional portfolio I built with React to showcase my expertise as a Software Engineer. I started building this site, and all its containing projects, shortly after I started learning React which really helped solidify my understanding of the framework.

Here are a few key things I learned:

- You can <span style="color: yellow">**animate page sections**</span> on scroll to fly in from the left of the screen ➡ by **adding a useRef** to the target element, **listening to the window height** compared to its position and **making it visible** once the element is in view.
- You can <span style="color: yellow">**stagger list items**</span> so they come in one at a time ➡ by giving each **child element** a slight **delay**.
- <span style="color: yellow">**Third party libraries**</span> can either **save or cost** you **significant development time**. For example, I used the "react-hamburger" library for the collapsable hamburger menu which saved me from having to create my own. But it also doesn't accept custom styles so that would need to be something you consider before taking the time to play around with it.

## Acknowledgements

For the hamburger button in the navbar, I used the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/hamburger-react" target="_blank">hamburger-react</a> library. 

<!-- TODO: List any blog posts, tutorials or plugins that you may have used to complete the project. Only list those that had a significant impact. Obviously, we all 'Google' stuff while working on our things, but maybe something in particular stood out as a 'major contributor' to your skill set for this project. -->
